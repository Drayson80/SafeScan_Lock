If you'd like to try the new version:

1. Download the latest archive at Releases · mikalhart/galileo-Servo · GitHub

2. Unzip the archive and use the two contained files (Servo.h and Servo.cpp) to overwrite those in ../hardware/arduino/x86/libraries/Servo.

3. Exit the Arduino IDE software and restart it.
